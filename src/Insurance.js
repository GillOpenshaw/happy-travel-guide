        <p>There's holiday/travel insurance to consider, depends on illness, where some insurance won't insure you, or it costs too much, doing insurance online it usually says can't offer insurance but phone the insurance company is how you can usually get insurance. Be prepared to tell the insurance company EVERYTHING about your illness - From latest blood results, scan reports, very important if have consent from your doctor, letter is also very useful if going through customs,  especially of have any medical devices or taking medication while abroad. Many charities such as Macmillan can not name an insurance brand /company, as the insurance criteria can change from year to year etc. Some illnesses can't get holiday insurance but the person goes on holiday n takes the risks ...
        I've had to tell them EVERYTHING about my medical condition, which is important to know as much as possible about your illness/ condition to get holiday insurance. Yes you CAN'T be spontaneous! ðŸ˜…xx
