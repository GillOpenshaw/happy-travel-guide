        <p>You just inform customs before hand ( if want can phone the airport before for more info)n they will say if safe enough to go through etc n I found great if baldy like me as you got checked behind a curtain for privacyüòÅ. With meds you will need a headed letter from doctor (showing full doctor contact details on letter)
        No problems, I was worried but the staff were great last year n I've got to remember that they deal with a lot of medical devices such as colostomies/heart pacemakers etc. If was also info on the airport website that I flew from last year. Xx
