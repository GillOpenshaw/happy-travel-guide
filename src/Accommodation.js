        <p>Accommodation will depend on your illness n immune system - if immune system is compromised, it might be safer to have self-catering, as can make own meals or if have problems with certain foods,  can cater for your own food preference. If want to eat out, it might be better to eat out towards end of holiday- so if have a case of food posion, it's at end of hols so less of hols is affected....
